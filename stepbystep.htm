			<h1>Step by step setup</h1>
			This page details the process of installing and configuring
			a functional cmail server.
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>1a Setup from packages</h2>
			Install the package with your package manager of choice (eg. dpkg, pacman).
			Depending on the package maintainer, this process may already run a dialog
			of some sorts querying basic configuration information.
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>1b Setup from source</h2>
			<i>(Examples given for debian-based systems)</i>
			<p>
			We're going to assume the system already sports a working C compiler
			as well as the git version control system. First, we're going to install the
			build prerequisites. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<code style="display:block;">
				~# apt-get install libsqlite3-dev<br/>
				~# apt-get install nettle-dev<br/>
				~# apt-get install libgnutls28-dev<br/>
				~# apt-get install libadns1-dev
			</code>
			</p>

			<p>
			Additionally, we're going to install some tools needed for initial setup operations.
			</p>
			<p>
			<code style="display:block;">
				~# apt-get install sqlite3<br/>
				~# apt-get install openssl<br/>
			</code>
			</p>

			<p>
			Next, we'll clone the cmail repository to the disk
			</p>
			<p>
			<code style="display:block;">
				~# git clone https://github.com/cmail-mta/cmail
			</code>
			</p>

			<p>
			In the cloned directory, run <code>make</code> to build all modules, followed
			by <code>make install</code> to copy the binaries to a system path (by default
			<code>/usr/sbin/</code>, this may be changed by supplying the environment variable
			<code>PREFIX</code>). Running <code>make init</code> after this step will create a
			new user for cmail (in order to minimize attack surface, cmail is not usually run as root
			and instead drops its privileges after initialization), copy over default configuration files,
			correctly set privileges and generally set up the basic structure needed for operation. 
			Alternatively, the <code>make tls-init</code> command does all that and also generates a temporary TLS
			certificate and key for initial usage and testing (openssl required). Please remember to replace the
			generated key and certificate with secure ones when using this option.
			</p>
			<p>
			<code style="display:block;">
				~# cd cmail<br/>
				~/cmail# make<br/>
				~/cmail# make install<br/>
				~/cmail# make tls-init
			</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			After these steps, the core cmail binaries as well as the administration tool suite will have
			been installed. Should you prefer using the web administration interface to the command line tools,
			the HTTP API and web panel need to be installed additionally.
			</p>

			<p>
			In order to have cmail start up at boot time, your init system may need specific files (such as service files
			or init scripts). Example files are provided in <code>startup-scripts/</code> for systemd and sysvinit.
			Check the documentation for your system to find out how to install these files.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>2 Check the generated configuration files</h2>
			... or copy them over from <code>example-configs/</code> if you do not want to use the
			provided setup mechanisms. Make sure to edit the BANNER parameters to <code>bind</code> directives
			to read something sensible (Most likely, this should be the hostname of your new mailserver).
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>2a Test the configuration</h2>
			This step might not be needed when installing from source, but it is nevertheless useful for learning
			how to debug your mail server.
			
			<p>
				To do this, run the daemons one by one without having them detach from the console, so you can
				see their debug information printed.

				<code style="display:block;">
					~# cmail-smtpd nodetach /etc/cmail/smtpd.conf<br/>
					~# cmail-popd nodetach /etc/cmail/popd.conf<br/>
					~# cmail-dispatchd nodetach /etc/cmail/dispatchd.conf<br/>
				</code>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>3 Set up the master database</h2>
			cmail uses <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, a file-based database to store
			most of its running configuration and data. Administration of a running cmail server
			can either be performed by using the cmail-admin suite of command line tools or by using
			the HTTP API and web panel.
